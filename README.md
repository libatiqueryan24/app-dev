Charlie Kenton is an ex-boxer who is trying to make some money through the business of robot fighting. However, no matter how strong a robot he has, he always loses, mostly because of his ill-timed decisions. He is drowning in debt and running away from the ones whom he owes money when the news of his ex-girlfriendâ€™s death is delivered to him. It turns out that his eleven-year-old son, whom he had abandoned a long time ago, has no one but him now. Debra, Maxâ€™s aunt, tries to get his custody, but Charlie needs to sign off on it. He sees this as an opportunity and gets Debraâ€™s rich husband, Marvin, to pay for giving away Max to them. The only catch here is that Charlie needs to keep Max for a month because Debra and Marvin have a trip planned to Italy that they cannot cancel. Charlie agrees to this and as Max accompanies him on his quest to make money through robot fighting, they discover an outdated robot named Atom abandoned in a junkyard.

My favorite robot movie! ðŸ¥Š ðŸ¤–
